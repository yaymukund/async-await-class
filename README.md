# RustConf Async/Await Class 2018

If you want to run the examples you'll need to have `cargo` and `rustc` installed:

1. It's recommended that you pin the directory to the correct nightly compiler so
   the examples work. To do this, create a file `rust-toolchain` with the contents
   `nightly-2018-08-18` 
2. `cargo run --bin timer`
3. `cargo run --bin executor`
